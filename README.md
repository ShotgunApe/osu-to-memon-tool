# osu-to-memon-tool
Convert timing points found in .osu file formats into .memon for charting purposes

# Usage:
VERY UNTESTED, likely wont work w/ every beatmap. You'll have better luck with beatmaps whose timing points are snapped to previous timing point

cmd: `python3 main.py "[path_to_file.osu]"`

Will produce output.memon file in 1.0.0 format. Afterward you'll need to add .ogg file to chart.
